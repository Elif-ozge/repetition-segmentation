# Rehabilitation Exercise Repetition Segmentation and Counting using Skeletal Body Joints
We present a novel approach for segmenting
and counting the repetitions of rehabilitation exercises performed
by patients, based on their skeletal body joints. Skeletal body
joints can be acquired through two means, depth cameras or
computer vision techniques applied to RGB videos of patients.
Various sequential neural networks, including many-to-many
models with binary sequence output and density map output
and many-to-one models with single output, are designed and
implemented to analyze the sequences of skeletal body joints
and perform repetition segmentation and counting. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available rehabilitation exercise
datasets, KIMORE, UI-PRMD, and IntelliRehabDS, demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous
methods. The proposed method enables accurate exercise analysis
while preserving patient privacy, facilitating the effective delivery
of virtual home-based rehabilitation programs.
